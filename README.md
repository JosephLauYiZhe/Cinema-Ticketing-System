# Cinema-Ticketing-System
This is a C++ project where the system can be divided into admin and
normal users. The program will require user to register an account at main
menu before login to user menu to book movie tickets. At user menu, user
can book tickets, cancel their booked tickets before payment and
perform payment. Admin can perform update on movies slots displayed
and check ticket records which will calculate the total income from
ticket earned.
